# Emotion Recognition

A project tackling Kaggle's Facial Expression Recognition challenge

## Getting Started

* Download the dataset (link below)
* Adjust the config file
* Build the dataset using build_dataset.py
* Train the model using train_rec.py
* Evaluate the model using test_rec.py

* To see the results in real time - run emotion_detect.py

## Dataset

[FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)

Dataset was turned into 3 HDF5 splits (training, validation and testing)
